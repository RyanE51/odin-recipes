The objective here is to practice my HTML skills to increase coding profficiency, problem solving skills, and improve my ability to troubleshoot.

I will be using HTML to create the structure of a website which will contain links to different pages within the site. Those pages will showcase recipes to prepare a variety of different dishes.
